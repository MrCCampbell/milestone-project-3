# **Milestone Project 3** 

## Building the site

### Introduction

For my third project I have decide to make a booking site for a fictional tour boat company on the Mekong river based at the riverside near the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. The site will have the ability to book a sight seeing cruise on the Mekong river. Choosing the time and day to avoid missing out on the experience as they can become crowded at certain days and times. Day cruises are where you can see many sights of historical and cultural importance and night cruise get to see the city at night.





### First steps

- First went to GitHub to start a new project board for my milestone project 3 with the new skills learnt from section 3 of the course. I have added  issues to the to-do section of the board. They have acceptance criteria and tasks with each one prioritised with importance.
